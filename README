Description:
This script is a reimplementation and continuation of the QuickFixNotes
script (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2216). Besides the
original functionality of capturing notes and storing them in a file, this
script provides commands for easily loading the stored data, also for
location lists.

Though the main functionality of this script is to make editing of quickfix
entries easy.

This script can be downloaded from https://github.com/jceb/vim-editqf

Usage:
Create entries in the quickfix list by either running special a command
like :make or :grep or add a note by pressing <leader>n. Then bring up the
quickfix window by running the command :cw.

When you are in the quickfix window navigate to the entry you want to
change. Just press any key that would bring in into insert mode or change
the text like "i".  Automatically a new window will be opened containing
all entries of the quickfix window.

You can use the regular editing commands for editing the entries. Once
you're done, just save the buffer and leave or close the window. I
recommend using :x, because this command does both with just one command.
After that you are brought back to the error you initially started editing
in the quickfix window.

Additionally the plugin provides the following commands that support
storing and restoring quickfix and location lists:
	:SaveQF <FILENAME>
	:LoadQF <FILENAME>  " default is to append to the current quickfix list
	:LoadQF! <FILENAME> " replace quickfix list with the contents of file
	:AddNoteQF [NOTE]   " add quickfix entry with message NOTE
	:AddNoteQF! [NOTE]  " like :AddNoteQF but start a new quickfix list
	:AddNoteQFPattern[!] [NOTE]   " add quickfix entry matching the pattern of the current line

	:SaveLoc <FILENAME>
	:LoadLoc <FILENAME>  " default is to append to the current location list
	:LoadLoc! <FILENAME> " replace location list with the contents of file
	:AddNoteLoc [NOTE]   " add location entry with message NOTE
	:AddNoteLoc! [NOTE]  " like :AddNoteLoc but start a new location list
	:AddNoteLocPattern[!] [NOTE]   " add location entry matching the pattern of the current line

Editqf has integrated support for the hier script
(http://www.github.com/jceb/vim-hier) which highlights quickfix errors to
make them more visible.
Customization:
The default filename for storing and loading quickfix and location lists is
customizable by setting the following variables in your vimrc:
	let g:editqf_saveqf_filename  = "quickfix.list"
	let g:editqf_saveloc_filename = "location.list"

Jump to the edited error when editing finished:
	let g:editqf_jump_to_error    = 1

The default keybinding <leader>n for adding a quickfix note can be
customized by defining a mapping in your vimrc:
	nmap <leader>n <Plug>AddNoteQF
	nmap <leader>N <Plug>AddNoteQFPattern
	nmap <leader>l <Plug>AddNoteLoc
	nmap <leader>L <Plug>AddNoteLocPattern

Installation Details:
1. Download editqf.vim
2. Move file to $HOME/.vim/plugin
3. Restart vim

Known Issues:
- When trying to edit a location list the quickfix list is opened instead!
  This is because it's not possible to tell the difference between a
  quickfix and a location list from vim script. A workaround is to open the
  location list manually: :e loc:list
- When opening a location list (filename loc:list) in a new window the
  location list of that window is opened instead! Location lists should
  always be edited by running :e loc:list. Once editing finished C-^
  should be used to leave the location list and go back to the last edited
  buffer
- Mapping <Plug>AddNoteQFPattern and <Plug>AddNoteLocPattern doesn't work
  quite well because vim seems to execute <Plug>AddNoteQF with paramter
  Pattern instead

Changelog:
